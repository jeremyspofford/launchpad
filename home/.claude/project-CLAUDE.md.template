# Project-Level Claude Code Configuration

> This file inherits all settings from `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` (global configuration, tool permissions, agent system, MCP tools).
> Add project-specific instructions below.

## Project Overview

**Project Name**: [Your project name]
**Type**: [e.g., Full-stack web app, API service, Infrastructure, CLI tool]
**Tech Stack**: [e.g., React, Node.js, PostgreSQL, AWS]

## Project-Specific Preferences

### Code Style & Conventions
- [Add any project-specific coding standards]
- [e.g., "Use functional components with hooks, not class components"]
- [e.g., "All API responses must follow the standard envelope format"]

### Architecture Notes
- [Document key architectural decisions]
- [e.g., "Backend follows repository pattern with services layer"]
- [e.g., "Frontend uses atomic design methodology"]

### Testing Requirements
- [Specify testing standards]
- [e.g., "All API endpoints require integration tests"]
- [e.g., "Components need at least 80% test coverage"]

## Important Files & Locations

**Configuration:**
- [e.g., `config/database.ts` - Database connection settings]
- [e.g., `.env.example` - Required environment variables]

**Core Modules:**
- [e.g., `src/services/auth.ts` - Authentication logic]
- [e.g., `src/lib/db.ts` - Database client]

**Documentation:**
- [e.g., `docs/api.md` - API documentation]
- [e.g., `docs/deployment.md` - Deployment guide]

## Development Workflow

### Setup
```bash
# Add project-specific setup commands
npm install
cp .env.example .env
npm run db:migrate
```

### Running Locally
```bash
# Add commands to run the project
npm run dev        # Start development server
npm run test       # Run tests
npm run build      # Build for production
```

### Deployment
- [Describe deployment process]
- [e.g., "Deploy to dev: `npm run deploy:dev`"]
- [e.g., "Merge to main triggers production deploy via GitHub Actions"]

## Agent Preferences for This Project

### Most Relevant Agents
- [List agents most useful for this project]
- [e.g., `frontend-agent` - React UI work]
- [e.g., `backend-agent` - API endpoints]
- [e.g., `database-agent` - Schema changes]
- [e.g., `aws-infrastructure-expert` - Infrastructure work]

### Project-Specific Agent Workflows
- [Document custom agent workflows]
- [e.g., "For new features: project-manager → orchestrator → database-agent → backend-agent → frontend-agent → verification-agent"]

## Known Issues & Workarounds

- [Document any quirks or known issues]
- [e.g., "Hot reload sometimes fails - restart dev server if changes don't appear"]
- [e.g., "S3 bucket permissions require manual setup - see docs/aws-setup.md"]

## External Dependencies & APIs

**Third-Party Services:**
- [e.g., Stripe API - Payment processing]
- [e.g., SendGrid - Email delivery]
- [e.g., Auth0 - Authentication]

**Required Credentials:**
- [List environment variables needed, but never include actual values]
- [e.g., `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` - Stripe API secret]
- [e.g., `DATABASE_URL` - PostgreSQL connection string]

## Current Work & Context

### Active Branches
- [Document current feature branches]
- [e.g., `feature/user-auth` - Adding JWT authentication]
- [e.g., `bugfix/api-timeout` - Fixing timeout issues]

### Recent Changes
- [Keep a log of major recent changes]
- [e.g., "2025-10-28: Migrated from REST to GraphQL"]
- [e.g., "2025-10-25: Added Redis caching layer"]

### TODO / Backlog
- [High-level tasks or features]
- [e.g., "Add rate limiting to API"]
- [e.g., "Implement user profile page"]
- [e.g., "Add monitoring and alerting"]

## Notes for Claude

[Add any specific instructions for Claude when working in this project]

**Examples:**
- "Always run tests before making changes to authentication code"
- "When modifying database schema, update Prisma schema first, then generate migration"
- "Frontend changes should be tested in both desktop and mobile viewports"
- "Infrastructure changes should be reviewed by aws-infrastructure-expert agent before deployment"
